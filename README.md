👋 Hello, I'm @TbsSantos.

👀 I have a strong passion for programming, applied mathematics, and statistics.

🌱 Currently, I'm in a learning process, primarily focusing on Python and Java, but I'm open to exploring other languages.

💞 I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects that allow me to enhance my skills and work with equally passionate individuals.

📫 You can reach me by sending an email to tbssantos@gmail.com.
